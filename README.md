# COS Ambassadors
COS Ambassadors are a group of global volunteers advocating for open research practices at their institutions. They promote the mission of the Center for Open Science, conduct trainings to faculty and staff, and provide valuable feedback to COS on improving its products and services. 

### Data Visualization
The Ambassador information is a rich dataset containing location data, open science activities performed, and areas of scientific interest as it pertains to the COS mission. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook of data visualizations regarding the COS Ambassadors and will be updated with more information.
